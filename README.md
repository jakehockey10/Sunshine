# Sunshine
This will serve as a springboard for the application we (Shaun Kane and I) will be building to research non-visual interaction methods in mobile gaming/applications.

  - This costs $2.99, but it might do everything that I'm trying to do with this first phase of the app.  We want to visualize the data, and see how different interactions effect it.  More discussion is needed.

# Android Studio
Android Studio is being used to develop the application and provide an easy way to test and run the application in DEBUG mode.

# [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)
The Android Developer site [suggested](http://developer.android.com/training/index.html) taking the Udacity Android Development course as a way to get familiar with Android development in general.  The Sunshine application is a weather app and is simple yet complex at the same time.  The tutorial includes making responsive UIs, application lifecycle management, using an internet connection, etc.  But it is simple in that all it does is give you information about the weather in the location of your choice.  Because the tutorial went in to more depth than was probably required, it seems suitable as a springboard for further development as it provides examples of how to go about implementing various features.  Due to the length of the free trial (14 days) I was not able to follow the tutorial while writing the code myself all the way through to the end, but got about 1/4 of the way through lesson 5 before time ran out.  There are seven lessons total (1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 6).  Before cancelling the subscription, I cloned the repo, including all branches at each stage of each lesson so that further investigation into how they developed certain features would be easier to determine.

# Supported versions
The minimum supported SDK version is 10 (at the moment), while the targeted SDK version is the latest, 21.  I'm thinking that the minimum SDK version will be raised later in development.
